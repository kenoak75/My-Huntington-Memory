    <p>One of the highlights of 2018 was giving my parents a guided tour of the Huntington Gardens.</p>

    <p>My mom and stepdad, affectionately known as “Frank Dad”, were visiting from Korea. They had originally come for our wedding in June but decided to extend their trip through the summer. Frank Dad, who is in his early 80s, had injured his leg a few months prior and was having difficulty walking on his own. He seemed most content watching television at home but my wife and I were determined to show both him and my mom what the Pasadena area had to offer.</p>

    <p>I had been working at the Huntington for about a year, so a visit to the Huntington was a given. I was excited and proud to show my parents the gorgeous place I was lucky enough to come to every day. Arrangements were made and the day of the visit finally came. I reserved a wheelchair for Frank Dad and mapped out our path through the Gardens.</p>

    <p>Everything seemed good to go until Frank Dad decided that he didn’t want to use a wheelchair. Knowing the expanse of the Gardens and the varying elevation levels, I tried to persuade him to change his mind. Nevertheless, he insisted he would be fine walking with his cane, and so we went.</p>

    <p>It was a clear July morning — bees were buzzing, lizards scurrying, my parents taking in the Desert Gardens at a slow and steady pace. They commented to one another in Korean about the variety of cacti and trees all around us. I could tell they were impressed. We stopped for a few minutes to watch a hummingbird as it quietly flitted about a bush. Things were going perfectly, but I knew that the uphill portion still lay ahead of us.</p>

    <p>We took a break at the entrance to the Japanese Gardens. I was eager to show my parents the Bonsai collection—my personal favorite part of the Huntington. As we began the winding climb, I noticed Frank Dad’s steps start to get smaller. This was definitely going to be more strenuous than the slight decline through the Desert Gardens. Still, Frank Dad kept walking, one small step after the other, right hand shakily gripping his cane. We finally made it to the top and took in the serene surroundings of the Bonsais and raked stone garden.</p>

    <p>When we reached the Chinese Gardens, I called security and asked for a Special Assistance Vehicle to be sent. This time, Frank Dad was happy to accept the wheeled assistance. We loaded into the shuttle, Mom and Frank Dad in front, my wife and I facing the road behind us. We watched as the path we took zipped beneath our feet.</p>

    <p id="bottom">Before leaving we stopped at the Red Car coffee shop for gelato. My mom and I perused the gift shop for some tea to bring back to her friends in Korea. Frank Dad and my wife were deep in conversation outside as they waited for us. I don’t know what they were talking about, but he looked quite happy to be sitting and that was enough for me.</p>
